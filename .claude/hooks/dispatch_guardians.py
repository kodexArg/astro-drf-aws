"""Guardian dispatch + ADR review nudge (PostToolUse on Write|Edit).

One prose-only PostToolUse hook, formerly two (dispatch_guardians.py and
adr_reminder.py, merged for the nudge-dedup issue). It does two jobs in a
single output block:
  - maps every written file to the guardian agents watching it (docs/agents/*.md)
    via WATCHLISTS and nudges a dispatch to verify the change;
  - names the ADR(s) to review when a governance-sensitive file is touched
    via RULES — wikilinks and a one-line "why review" only, never rule
    restatement (adr-00 rule 1).
WATCHLISTS mirrors the Watchlist section of each agent file — keep them in
sync (adr-03-guardians rule 5: exactly two places, identical in coverage).

Doctrine-tier docs (PRD/REQUIREMENTS/LOCALISATION/INFRASTRUCTURE/HARNESS) can
move under docs/constitution/ or elsewhere without notice; guardians_for()
falls back to a docs/-relative basename match for any exact (non-glob)
"docs/*.md" watchlist entry, so a future doc reshuffle degrades to "still
matches" rather than "silently no-ops".

Both jobs dedupe per session-scoped batch: each guardian/ADR is named once
per session, not once per file, via a gitignored seen-set at
$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/.nudge-seen-<session_id>. Any internal error
exits 0; always exits 0.
