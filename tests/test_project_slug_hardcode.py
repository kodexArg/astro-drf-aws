"""Anti-hardcode guard for the project slug (issue #133).

The literal string this template ships as its reference project slug MUST
NOT appear typed out across the tree — the single source of truth is the
`PROJECT_SLUG` environment variable (frontend-derived form:
`PUBLIC_PROJECT_SLUG`), never a copy-pasted literal. See docs/VARIABLES.md
("Sanctioned PROJECT_SLUG consumption points") for the full inventory this
allowlist encodes, and docs/GLOSSARY.md ("project slug" row) for the naming
decision.

These are the well-determined places the literal may still appear:
  (a) the file is a Markdown doc (`*.md`) — narrative/reference prose is
      exempt whole-file;
  (b) the file is `.env` or `.env.example` — local dev config, not app code;
  (c) the line also contains the literal `PROJECT_SLUG` — every sanctioned
      single-source fallback carries this token alongside the literal, e.g.
      `os.environ.get("PROJECT_SLUG", "<slug>")`,
      `${PROJECT_SLUG:-<slug>}`, `PUBLIC_PROJECT_SLUG ?? "<slug>"`, or the
      deploy workflow's `PROJECT_SLUG: <slug>` line — the literal there is
      the one legitimate seed value, not a stray copy;
  (d) the line also contains `LIVE-DOC` — a generated live-doc block header
      (adr-19-live-doc-backlinks), not a hardcode;
  (e) a short, explicit EXCEPTIONS list below, for opaque values that are
      not derivable from PROJECT_SLUG at all: `.github/workflows/
      deploy-prod.yml` lines holding one of the six AWS-random-suffix ARNs
      baked in at provisioning time (issue #129); `.claude/hooks/
      graph_first.py`'s codebase-memory-mcp project id (a different
      identifier namespace, not this app's PROJECT_SLUG);
      `tests/test_graph_first_hook.py`'s derivation fixtures — it types a
      sample checkout path and the retired literal to prove graph_first.py
      derives the id at runtime and to guard against the literal's return,
      the same self-referential need rule (f) grants this guard; and
      `.claude/kdx-park.json`'s `repo` routing target — kdx-draft-issue's
      park-mode file, harness tooling, not this app's PROJECT_SLUG (#307);
  (f) this test file itself — it necessarily types the literal it searches
      for;
  (g) a guardian name — `astro-drf-aws-prd`, `astro-drf-aws-adr`, or
      `astro-drf-aws-api` — is a SEPARATE naming axis (an agent identity,
      not the project slug), guarded on its own by
      `tests/test_guardian_identity_triangle.py`. A line is allowed under
      this rule if, after stripping every guardian-name token, no bare
      `astro-drf-aws` remains on it; a bare occurrence (not part of a
      guardian token) still fails.

Anything else is a hardcode and fails the test.
