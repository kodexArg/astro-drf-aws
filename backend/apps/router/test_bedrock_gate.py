"""The blocking Bedrock connectivity gate as a pytest test (#253).

Marked `bedrock_live`: excluded from the default suite (like `cognito_live`)
and run explicitly by the deploy pipeline with OIDC credentials, where it
HARD-FAILS on any unreachability — network, IAM grant, or model access.
It wraps the same `check_bedrock_connectivity` command a developer runs
from the terminal, so both gate entrances prove the identical real path.
