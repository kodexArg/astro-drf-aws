"""Inference clients for the chatbot router choosing tier.

`BedrockInferenceClient` is the real client: a `boto3` `bedrock-runtime`
`converse` call at temperature 0 whose only sanctioned output is one verbatim
member of the closed menu ([[adr-17-chatbot-two-tier]] rule 7); anything else
is hard-rejected by the caller, never repaired. It is synchronous by design —
callers on the event loop wrap it in `asgiref.sync_to_async`, never
`aiobotocore` ([[adr-18-async-mandatory]] rule 4).

`MockInferenceClient` is the DEBUG-only deterministic stand-in: it never hits
the network and always returns a menu member. `get_inference_client` gates it
exactly as the dev-auth path is gated ([[adr-14-auth]] rule 6 precedent):
`DEBUG=False` can never reach the mock.
