# ADR-19 — live-doc backlinks in code

## CONTEXT

> Every matched code file carries exactly one live-doc block naming the
> ADRs and docs that govern it. CODEMAP.md is the generated inverse index.

Rules only; the block name and mechanics live in [[GLOSSARY]] and
[[HARNESS]]; the file→doc mapping lives in the linker manifest, never here.

## ASSERTIONS

1. Every code file the manifest matches carries exactly one live-doc block
   ([[GLOSSARY]]: live-doc block) — a delimited region (`LIVE-DOC:START` …
   `LIVE-DOC:END`) wrapped in that file's native comment syntax, placed at
   the top of the file. A matched file without the block, or with more than
   one, is a defect.
2. The block holds wikilinks only — never information. It names the ADRs
   that govern the file and the docs those ADRs own, as `[[wikilinks]]`, and
   nothing else: no prose, no restatement of a rule, no explanation. A block
   that paraphrases a doc violates this ADR exactly as an ADR that inlines a
   fact violates [[adr-00-adr-doctrine]] rule 1.
3. The mapping of file → links is owned by the linker manifest, not by any
   code file or this ADR. Adding, narrowing, or widening a file's governance
   is an edit to the manifest followed by a re-run; a block hand-edited to
   disagree with the manifest is drift, corrected by re-running, never by
   amending the block.
4. `models.py`, `views.py`, `viewsets.py`, `serializers.py`, `urls.py`, and
   the permission classes additionally cite `[[API]]` — the one doc, beyond
   the ADRs, that the route surface answers to
   ([[adr-07-api-and-backend]]). No other file type cites [[API]] from its
   block.
5. The doc→code direction is generated, never hand-kept. `docs/CODEMAP.md`
   is produced by the linker from the blocks; it is not a source of truth
   and is not edited by hand. The block is the SSOT of a file's governance;
   CODEMAP is its inverse index.
6. The block never becomes a second SSOT. It duplicates no rule and grants
   no authority; where a block and a doc could be read to disagree, the doc
   wins ([[adr-00-adr-doctrine]]). Wikilinks in code do not produce Obsidian
   backlinks — CODEMAP is the graph, and the block is a greppable pointer
   for humans and agents reading the file.
7. The linker is the sanctioned path, vendored per [[adr-02-harness]] and
   listed in [[HARNESS]]. Applying or checking blocks runs it; blocks are
   not authored by hand. Its manifest and script are harness tooling, not
   doctrine.
