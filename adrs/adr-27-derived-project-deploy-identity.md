# ADR-27 — the derived project's deploy identity

## CONTEXT

> A project spawned from this template inherits the pipeline's shape and
> nothing about where it deploys. Every target is repository configuration
> read at run time, and a deploy with none configured fails closed rather
> than reaching for the parent's infrastructure.

## ASSERTIONS

1. A deploy target is repository configuration, never a committed literal.
   The AWS account, deploy role, project slug, cluster, subnets, security
   group and secret ARNs a workflow uses are read at run time from that
   repository's own GitHub Actions variables. Typing any of them into a
   workflow file is a defect — not for secrecy, none of them is a secret,
   but because a committed value is inherited by every repo spawned from
   the template and points at the parent's infrastructure.
2. A deploy whose target is not configured fails closed, before
   authenticating. The workflow's first job verifies every required
   variable is set and hard-fails naming those that are not; no job assumes
   a role, pushes an image, registers a task definition or runs a migration
   ahead of that check.
3. A project owns its identity, never a sibling's. A spawned repo inherits
   no account, role, cluster, network, secret path or inventory. Until its
   own resources exist, the fail-closed state of rule 2 is the correct and
   expected one.
4. The owning account is a per-repository fact recorded in [[GH]]
   ([[adr-12-github-and-git]] rules 1 and 4). Owning the template a project
   was spawned from grants no authority over the project. Everything else
   [[adr-12-github-and-git]] rules — `main` is integration, `prod` is
   production, and only the owning `gh` identity pushes those lines — binds
   unchanged.
5. A change of owner or repository rotates the OIDC identity and both
   directions are re-derived: the live prefix is read from GitHub, recorded
   in [[GH]], and every trust entry naming the repo is re-derived in the
   same batch ([[adr-24-oidc-immutable-subject-claim]] rules 1–2). A prefix
   inherited from the template describes the template.
6. Provisioning is a separate act and its record is [[INVENTORY]]. No
   document, workflow or test may assume this project has provisioned
   resources while [[INVENTORY]] records none.

## FORBIDDEN

- **NEVER** commit a deploy target into a workflow file (rule 1). The
  template copies it forward, and the copy aims a child project at its
  parent's account.
- **NEVER** assume a role or push an image before the configuration check
  (rule 2). A deploy blocked only by a mismatched credential is not a
  control; it is an accident a later change can undo.
- **NEVER** borrow a sibling project's account, role, cluster or secret path
  (rule 3). Fail-closed is the correct state until this project's own
  resources exist.
- **NEVER** carry the template's OIDC prefix into a derived repo (rule 5).
  It describes the template and can only ever deny this project's deploy.
- **NEVER** claim authority over a project because you own the template it
  came from (rule 4). The owning account is recorded per repository in
  [[GH]].
- **NEVER** write a document or test that assumes resources [[INVENTORY]]
  does not record (rule 6).

## REJECTED

- **Committing the deploy target as a default a project overrides** — the
  template's own account and cluster in the workflow, expected to be edited
  after spawning. Rejected because the edit is exactly what gets forgotten,
  and the failure mode is a child project deploying into its parent's
  account rather than an error.
- **Letting a missing variable fail at role assumption** — no pre-check,
  relying on AWS to deny. Rejected by rule 2: the denial is incidental, it
  names nothing useful, and a later credential change turns the accident
  into a successful wrong deploy.
