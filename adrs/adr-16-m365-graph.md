# ADR-16 — Microsoft Graph app-only capability

## CONTEXT

> Graph is a capability layer, not a second login IdP: app-only
> `client_credentials`, zero human interaction, no token storage.

Rules only; content lives in [[API]], [[VARIABLES]].

## ASSERTIONS

1. Microsoft Graph is a capability layer, not a second login IdP, and is
   app-only. Cognito remains the sole authentication provider
   ([[adr-14-auth]]); the `m365` app authenticates to Graph via OAuth2
   `client_credentials` (owner override, supersedes the delegated-only
   design) — zero human interaction, no user tokens, no browser flow.
2. No token is ever stored. The app has no models. An access token is
   minted per request via `msal.ConfidentialClientApplication.acquire_token_for_client`
   and discarded; refresh-at-rest rules are moot under this mode.
3. Named exception, bounded to two routes: `GET /api/m365/hello/` and
   `GET /api/m365/world/` are deliberately `AllowAny`, no session required —
   an explicit owner-directed scope reduction for demo purposes. This does
   not widen RBAC doctrine ([[adr-14-auth]]) anywhere else; every other
   route in this app follows normal auth.
4. No mock mode, no resource catalog, no KMS in this cut. Graph addresses
   (site host, site path, workbook item, worksheet) are hardcoded Python
   constants in `graph.py`; YAGNI supersedes any catalog/mock design for
   this build.
5. Graph REST v1.0 only. No beta endpoints.
6. `MSGRAPH_RESOURCE_CATALOG` is out of scope for code in this cut — omitted
   from [[VARIABLES]] because doctrine requires a row only for a variable
   actually read ([[adr-07-api-and-backend]] rule 7). Same for
   `MSGRAPH_SCOPES` and `MSGRAPH_TOKEN_FERNET_KEY`: app-only mode reads
   neither (the `.default` scope is a hardcoded constant), so both are
   dropped from settings and [[VARIABLES]].
