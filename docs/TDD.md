# TDD — instruction manual for `docs/tdds/`

> [!note] Active
> Every new backend piece is born here, wherever its subject exists ([[adr-11-development-flow]] r6). The template ships no `tdd-NN` entries; a project creates its own under `docs/tdds/`.

## Scope

> [!important] Backend only
> The TDD flow covers Django/DRF code exclusively. Frontend testing is owned by [[FRONTEND]] and is explicitly excluded from this flow.

## Purpose

From activation onward, every new piece of backend code is **born here**. `docs/tdds/` is where backend code generation starts — never directly in the code. No model, endpoint, service, or command exists before its TDD entry does.

## The flow

1. An approved [[API]] row exists (the contract comes first).
2. Create `docs/tdds/tdd-NN-slug.md` — sequential `NN`, kebab-case slug — following the section layout described below.
3. Write the failing tests the entry lists. Run them; they must fail.
4. Write `models.py` changes.
5. Implement until green.
6. Mark the entry `done`.

## Entry frontmatter contract

Every entry carries:

```yaml
title: tdd-NN-slug
type: tdd
status: draft | red | green | done
created: YYYY-MM-DD
api: []        # list of the [[API]] rows/paths this entry covers
tags: [tdd]
```

Status transitions:

- `draft` — entry written, tests not yet coded.
- `red` — tests exist and fail; implementation may begin.
- `green` — implementation passes every listed test.
- `done` — implementation notes filled; entry closed.

> [!note] One entry, one coherent piece
> An entry covers a single coherent unit of code: a model plus its endpoints, a service, a management command. Entries are small. If an entry needs a plural of concerns, split it.

## Entry layout

Every entry follows the frontmatter contract and flow above; a project's first entry sets the section layout that the rest reuse. Do not invent divergent layouts.

## Relationship to BDD

Features arriving from users enter via [[BDD]] first. The backend half of a BDD entry lands here as one or more TDD entries; link the originating BDD entry from each.
