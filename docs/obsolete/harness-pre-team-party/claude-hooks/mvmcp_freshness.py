"""markdown-vault MCP freshness guard (SessionStart).

The markdown-vault-docs MCP is the first source of truth for docs/ content
([[adr-20-markdown-vault-mcp]], [[AGENTS]]). A stale index answers confidently
about prose that no longer matches, so this hook compares the newest docs/*.md
mtime against the project-local index and warns when the vault has drifted — and
tells the agent to bootstrap when the project-local venv/index does not exist yet.
It never blocks; any internal error exits 0 (fail-open).

Bootstrap / rebuild:  python3 scripts/mvmcp.py bootstrap
Incremental refresh:  call the markdown-vault-docs `reindex` tool.
