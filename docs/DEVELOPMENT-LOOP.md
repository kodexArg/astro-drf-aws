title: DEVELOPMENT-LOOP
type: reference
---

> [!important] This file owns the loop — definition and operational rendering
> The development loop is **defined here** and given force by [[adr-11-development-flow]]; [[PRD]] states the objective the loop serves, never the loop itself. This file carries both the canonical definition (below) and its operational rendering — the exact sequence and the tool or skill used at each step. Every other rule stays with its own SSOT: each node points at the file that owns it, and this runbook links rather than re-explaining ([[adr-00-adr-doctrine]] rule 1). Where a diagram could be read to disagree with a rule, the ADR-backed doc wins.

> [!warning] Read at code-start
> Open this before starting any code. It assumes [[PRD]] and [[API]] are already held in memory (the standing requirement in [[AGENTS]]) and that the ABC gate has cleared.

## The canonical workflows — the definition

A general definition, not a rigid script; [[adr-11-development-flow]] gives it force.

**The development loop:**

`idea → user-facing? → [[BDD]] → … → needs backend? → enter through [[API]]`

The backend zone is entered only through [[API]]:

1. Confirm the need cannot be met by the endpoints already declared in [[API]].
2. If it cannot: add the row to [[API]].
3. Enter the [[TDD]] flow — its normal cycle, driven by the harness skills.
4. **Checkpoint — does [[API]] solve the need?** Yes → return to the frontend track. No → loop back to 1.

The checkpoint is what defines the loop: the backend zone is exited only when [[API]] answers the feature's need.

**New backend piece:**

`plan → [[API]] → [[TDD]] → models.py → rest of DRF`

**New user-facing feature:**

`[[BDD]] → backend half → [[TDD]] → …`
`         → frontend half → tests per [[FRONTEND]] → implementation`

Both are active: every gate binds now, wherever its subject exists ([[adr-11-development-flow]] rule 6). The sections below render each one step by step.

## 0 · Boot — orientation before any code

Every use case shares this prefix. Code structure resolves through `codebase-memory-mcp`; `docs/` prose through the `markdown-vault-docs` MCP ([[adr-20-markdown-vault-mcp]]); [[PRD]] and [[API]] stay in memory; then the ABC gate ([[AGENTS]]).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S(["Session start / new task"]) --> G{"codebase-memory graph fresh?"}
    G -->|stale| GR["index_repository mode=full"]
    G -->|fresh| MEM["Hold PRD + API in memory"]
    GR --> MEM
    MEM --> SRC["code → codebase-memory MCP<br/>docs → markdown-vault-docs MCP"]
    SRC --> ABC{"ABC gate:<br/>A follows PRD? · B complies with ADRs? · C modifies API?"}
    ABC -->|clears| READY(["Ready — pick a use-case loop"])
    ABC -->|fails| STOP(["Fix or stop — no code until ABC clears"])
```

## 0.5 · The change wrapper — issue in, PR out

Every use-case loop below is wrapped by the mandatory shape of [[adr-04-issue-delivery]]: it opens with a `gh` issue and closes with a PR, never a direct commit to `main`. The worktree is optional; the issue and the PR are not.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ISS(["Open gh issue<br/>always, for every change"]) --> WT{"Isolate?"}
    WT -->|optional| WK["git worktree<br/>claude --worktree '#N'"]
    WT -->|plain| BR["feature branch"]
    WK --> WORK["…run the use-case loop (§1–§3)…"]
    BR --> WORK
    WORK --> PR["Open PR → main"]
    PR --> GATE{"PR gate:<br/>guardians ✔ · tests ✔"}
    GATE -->|red| WORK
    GATE -->|green| MERGE["Merge as gh/kodexArg<br/>self-merge valid"]
    MERGE --> CLEAN(["Delete worktree (git worktree remove)<br/>+ branch — nothing outlives the PR"])
```

The tail `Open PR → gate → merge → delete worktree` replaces the old "commit on main" step of every loop that follows; each §-loop renders only its own middle, entered after the issue and exited into the PR. SSOTs: [[adr-04-issue-delivery]] · [[adr-12-github-and-git]] · [[GH]] · guardians [[adr-03-guardians]].

## 1 · Use case — a user-facing feature

The master loop, gated by [[adr-11-development-flow]]. Its ladder decision resolves through [[adr-08-frontend-and-design-system]] (criteria owned by [[HTMX]]); its backend excursion is §2.

> [!warning] `check` ≠ `build` ≠ `smoke` — three distinct verification layers
> Verify in order: `bun run check` (typecheck, agent) → `bun run build` (production bundle, agent, **headless, exit 0 required, before merge**) → browser smoke (`kodex`-only). The build gate is neither smoke nor `kodex`-only, and a green typecheck alone does not clear it. What each layer is and why they differ is owned by [[FRONTEND]] (*Testing → Verification layers*); this callout only names the ordering ([[adr-00-adr-doctrine]] rule 1).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    I(["Idea"]) --> UF{"User-facing?"}
    UF -->|no| BE["Backend zone — see §2"]
    UF -->|yes| BDD["BDD entry in docs/bdds/<br/>author: obsidian-markdown"]
    BDD --> LAD{"Interactivity ladder<br/>decided in the BDD"}
    LAD -->|server-owned state| HTMX["HTMX fragment: Django template + hx-attrs"]
    LAD -->|rich client state| ISL["Svelte island — skill: kdx-astro-7"]
    HTMX --> NB{"Needs backend?"}
    ISL --> NB
    NB -->|yes| BE
    NB -->|no| FE["Frontend build<br/>kdx-astro-7 + DESIGN-SYSTEM + MELT-UI"]
    BE --> RET{"Checkpoint: API solves the need?"}
    RET -->|yes| FE

    LD --> GRD{"Touched PRD / ADR / API surface?"}
    GRD -->|yes| GUARD["Engage guardian(s)"]
    GRD -->|no| PR["PR tail — §0.5:<br/>open PR → gate → merge → delete worktree"]
    GUARD --> PR
```

SSOTs per step: [[BDD]] · [[FRONTEND]] · [[DESIGN-SYSTEM]] · [[MELT-UI]] · [[HTMX]] · [[API]] · verification in [[FRONTEND]]/[[BDD]] · [[adr-19-live-doc-backlinks]] · guardians [[adr-03-guardians]] · [[GH]].

## 2 · Use case — a new backend endpoint

The API-first sequence ([[adr-07-api-and-backend]]) and the checkpoint exit ([[adr-11-development-flow]]) as they are actually walked.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    N(["Backend need"]) --> Q{"Already declared in API?"}
    Q -->|yes| REUSE(["Reuse endpoint — no new row"])
    Q -->|no| ROW["Add row to docs/API.md<br/>engage astro-drf-aws-api first"]
    ROW --> PLAN["plan"]
    PLAN --> TESTS["Write pytest first — TDD<br/>skill: kdx-django-6-drf"]
    TESTS --> MODELS["models.py"]
    MODELS --> DRF["serializer → viewset → urls"]
    DRF --> VARS{"Reads a new env var?"}
    VARS -->|yes| VDOC["Declare in VARIABLES<br/>secrets → Secrets Manager only"]
    VARS -->|no| GREEN["Tests green"]
    VDOC --> GREEN
    GREEN --> CHK{"Checkpoint: API solves the need?"}
    CHK -->|no| Q
    CHK -->|yes| LD["Stamp live-doc, block cites API<br/>skill: kdx-live-doc"]
    LD --> GUARD["Guardians: api + adr"]
    GUARD --> PR(["PR tail — §0.5:<br/>open PR → gate → merge → delete worktree"])
```

SSOTs per step: [[API]] · [[TDD]] · [[BACKEND]] · [[VARIABLES]] · [[CACHE]] (every response carries an explicit `Cache-Control`) · [[adr-19-live-doc-backlinks]] · guardians [[adr-03-guardians]].

## 3 · Use case — a docs / doctrine change

Here the docs *are* the product. An ADR rule change runs the supersession lifecycle ([[adr-00-adr-doctrine]]); prose is authored with `obsidian-markdown` and reached through the vault MCP; the matching guardian is engaged before the batch closes ([[adr-03-guardians]]).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    D(["Doctrine / docs change"]) --> W{"What is touched?"}
    W -->|ADR rule| ADR["Supersession check, adr-00<br/>semantic → new ADR, defer old"]
    W -->|docs prose / wikilinks| PROSE["Edit via markdown-vault-docs<br/>author: obsidian-markdown"]
    W -->|PRD / AGENTS| PRDN["Edit PRD / AGENTS"]
    ADR --> REIDX["Vault fresh — freshness before answers are trusted"]
    PROSE --> REIDX
    PRDN --> REIDX
    REIDX --> GUARD{"Engage the matching guardian"}
    GUARD -->|ADR / governed file| GA["astro-drf-aws-adr"]
    GUARD -->|PRD / goal| GP["astro-drf-aws-prd"]
    GUARD -->|API| GI["astro-drf-aws-api"]
    GA --> NOTIFY["Honor each guardian's notify list"]
    GP --> NOTIFY
    GI --> NOTIFY
    NOTIFY --> PR(["PR tail — §0.5:<br/>open PR → gate → merge → delete worktree"])
```

SSOTs per step: [[adr-00-adr-doctrine]] · [[adr-20-markdown-vault-mcp]] · [[adr-03-guardians]] · [[GLOSSARY]] (a new name gets its row first) · [[GH]].

## Variants

- **Frontend-only** change → the `Needs backend? = no` branch of §1; [[API]] is never entered. The `bun run build` gate still runs headless before merge (see the §1 callout): this branch carries the fewest gates, so the bundle is where a broken import or SSR error surfaces.
- **Infra / AWS** change → the shape of §2 with the `kdx-aws-*` skills in place of [[API]]/[[TDD]]; the resource row lands in [[INVENTORY]] and carries the mandatory tag set ([[INFRASTRUCTURE]], [[adr-15-ephemeral-run]]).
- **Smoke tests** are `kodex`-only and interactive; an agent routine that reaches a smoke step stops and defers ([[AGENTS]]).
